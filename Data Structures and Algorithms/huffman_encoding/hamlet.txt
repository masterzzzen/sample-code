Introducing: Link Issues & Pull Requests
Pull requests usually relate to at least one GitHub issue, so it makes sense you'd want to track them together as one unit through the development process.

We've made it a lot easier to do just that. Using ZenHub, you can attach pull requests to their corresponding issue, then track them together on your advanced task boards.
