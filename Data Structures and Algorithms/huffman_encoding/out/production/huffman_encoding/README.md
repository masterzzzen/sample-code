In order to run this code, first download the huffman_encoding package.   
Then load the package into Intellij by selecting File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources.  
 Then select this directory "huffman_encoding" and click OK. 
  Then click through all of the default options. 
  
After the project has been created, run Huff.java. This will encode the input file. There is an existing testing file named "romeo.txt". When Huff.java runs, the console will ask you for an input file name. You type type in romeo.txt, without quotes. If you wish to create your own input file, make sure that place it outside the /project directory.
